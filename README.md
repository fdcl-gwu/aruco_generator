## Aruco marker generator

You can generate any arbitrary sized aruco marker using OpenCV and anaconda.

There is also a LaTeX example to create a large poster sized marker as well.

## Installation

A conda environment file is included which you can use to duplicate the software environment.
Just run the following command, after installing Anaconda:

~~~
conda env create -f opencv3_contrib.yml
~~~

Next activate the enviornment using `source activate opencv3`
